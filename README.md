# A replica of site from the festival Future Island/rockWerchter
This was an assignment early in my first year where we learned how to use click event and event-listeners,
here we also learned how to make a menu that u can open and close

this was made purely with Javascript and made use of Json files as data and had a countdown timer to the actual event.
